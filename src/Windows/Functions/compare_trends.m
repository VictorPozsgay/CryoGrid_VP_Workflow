% compare_trends
%   Compare trends between observed and predicted data:
%   - Smoothing (moving average)
%   - Linear regression (overall slope)
%   - Spearman correlation (rank-based)
%   - Local directional agreement (%)
%
% INPUTS:
%   - obs           : observed data (vector)
%   - pred          : predicted data (vector)
%   - smooth_window : moving average window size (e.g., 7)
%
% OUTPUT:
%   - results : structure with 3 trend indicators
